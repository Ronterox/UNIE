# UNIE Stuff Tools

### PDF Scraper

Will probably add:

- Select different profiles of firefox
- Specify the pages by input
- Optimize the selenium script to run all of the requests in one task
    - (Optional) Maybe just make it so it doesn't close the browser sadge
- Install dependencies if you don't have any of them
- Extra summaries as info panels, and the whole chunk from where it came from
- Show total time taken
- Make it a hidden task, and pretty loading bar
- Output a folder with the books name
